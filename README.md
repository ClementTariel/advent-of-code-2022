# advent-of-code-2022

I started to learn rust on the 1st of December so the quality of the code is not great especially for the first days.


To test the solution of the last day, run `cargo run`.

To test the solution of a specific day, run `AOC_DAY=XX cargo run` where "XX" is the day you want to test.

For example `AOC_DAY=7 cargo run` or `AOC_DAY=05 cargo run` or `AOC_DAY=18 cargo run`
