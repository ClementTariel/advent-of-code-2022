# advent-of-code-2022

I started to learn rust on the 1st of December so the quality of the code is not great especially for the first days.

To test a solution, first you need to manually type the correct import in main.rs (at src/main.rs) so if you want to test the solution for day YZ you need to replace all "dayXX" by "dayYZ". Then go to the corresponding folder (so at src/challenge/dayYZ) and run `cargo run`.
